# Work Scheduler

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to create an application for users to be able to schedule daily work events.
- Will help user avoid scheduling conflicts at work by being able by schedule events at diffrent time slots during business hours.
- I learned how to pass live date and time onto a page and use for loop to change class of elements based on current time.


## Usage

To the right of each time block, user can enter events needed to be scheduled for certain hours of the day in the text feild. The background of the text feild displays gray if that time slot is in the past. It will display salmon if it is the current hour. Green if it is in the future.
